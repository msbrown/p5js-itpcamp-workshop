* Download ZIP of this repository.
* Unzip package, and open the folder.
* On Mac, open Terminal.
* Type `cd`, drag the `p5js-itpcamp-workshop` folder onto Terminal, and then hit enter.
	* Before your hit enter, make sure the command looks something like `cd /Users/ctarakajian/Development/projects/p5js-itp-camp`.
